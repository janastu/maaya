Give our drums back

00:00:34.000--> 00:00:36.000
Give our drums back

00:00:46.000--> 00:00:54.000
This song is inspired from 'ithihasa'

00:01:11.000--> 00:01:20.000
Our songs and dance are facing extinction. This is attempt to keep the form alive

00:01:32.000--> 00:01:45.000
Traditionally we use buffalo skin and horns to make drums, 
Traditionally this is a prayer performance to get rid of the ghosts.

00:01:52.000--> 00:01:55.000
Earlier we used skin and bamboo from the forest

00:01:55.000--> 00:01:58.000
Now we are not allowed to get these from the forest

00:02:04.000--> 00:02:06.000
We don't have money to buy these from the market

00:02:24.000--> 00:02:25.000
Give our drums back
